# Pierre Kawak Academic CV (LaTeX + PDF)

This repository hosts my academic curriculum vitae (CV) in two forms:

- **PDF**: for quick viewing/downloading
- **LaTeX source**: for transparency and for anyone who wants to adapt the template

## Quick access

- **`Kawak_Academic_CV.pdf`**: the compiled CV (recommended if you just want to read it)
- **`Kawak_Academic_CV.tex`**: the LaTeX source used to generate the PDF

## Supporting files (for compilation/customization)

The `.tex` file pulls from several BibTeX databases:

- **`articles.bib`**: peer-reviewed publications
- **`nopeer_articles.bib`**: non-peer-reviewed articles / preprints (if applicable)
- **`software.bib`**: published software
- **`talks.bib`**: technical talks / presentations

## If you want to adapt this CV

1. Copy/fork this repo.
2. Edit `Kawak_Academic_CV.tex` and update it with your details.
3. Update the `.bib` files to match your publications/talks/software.
4. Compile with your preferred LaTeX workflow (e.g., `pdflatex` + `bibtex`, or `latexmk`).
