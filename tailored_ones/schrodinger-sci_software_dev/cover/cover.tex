% The material below is a big dang thing whose purpose is just to set up a fixed coordinate system for \tikz so that you can put the Department or School address in the upper right-hand side without it moving all around every time you change something on the page.  I think it works.
% Defining a new coordinate system for the page:
%
% --------------------------
% |(-1,1)    (0,1)    (1,1)|
% |                        |
% |(-1,0)    (0,0)    (1,0)|
% |                        |
% |(-1,-1)   (0,-1)  (1,-1)|
% --------------------------

	% Save the upper right corner

The vertical spacing (\vspace) and the scaling will have to be adjusted to get things to look correct for your particular signature image. Alternatively, comment out the following line in favor of the one labeled "[[Alternate]]" if you want to sign a paper copy of the letter.

		% This line sets up the return address to the right-side of the OSU logo.  The location is set with absolute node addresses using ``\tikz''.  It can still be a bit fussy, and you may need to alter this a little to get things to look right.  The bit that changes the position are the numbers in parentheses ``at (14.2,2.7)''

    I'm excited to apply for the \textbf{Scientific Software Developer} position on the \textbf{Force Fields team} at Schrödinger. With 11+ years of experience developing modular molecular simulation tools in Python and C++, I bring a unique blend of deep domain knowledge and robust engineering practices to support atomistic modeling at scale.

    My work focuses on building physics-based models and simulation workflows that help explore complex material behavior with experimental accuracy. I've developed custom Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics frameworks, and I've tailored force fields--particularly OPLS--to model glass transition in copolymers, optimizing material performance without altering feedstock or processing. My work integrates test-driven development, unit-tested C++ and Python modules, and high-throughput HPC automation to ensure reliability across workflows spanning 500+ simulations and 50+ TB of data.

    What draws me to Schrödinger is the opportunity to collaborate with brilliant scientists while contributing clean, scalable code to the tools that power chemical and materials discovery. I'm passionate about translating scientific challenges into elegant software solutions--and I'd be thrilled to bring that mindset to your Force Fields team.

    Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Schrödinger's mission to improve human health through innovative computational science.
