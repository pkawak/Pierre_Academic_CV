% The material below is a big dang thing whose purpose is just to set up a fixed coordinate system for \tikz so that you can put the Department or School address in the upper right-hand side without it moving all around every time you change something on the page.  I think it works.
% Defining a new coordinate system for the page:
%
% --------------------------
% |(-1,1)    (0,1)    (1,1)|
% |                        |
% |(-1,0)    (0,0)    (1,0)|
% |                        |
% |(-1,-1)   (0,-1)  (1,-1)|

Alternatively, comment out the following line in favor of the one labeled "[[Alternate]]" if you want to sign a paper copy of the letter.

		% This line sets up the return address to the right-side of the OSU logo.  The location is set with absolute node addresses using ``\tikz''.  It can still be a bit fussy, and you may need to alter this a little to get things to look right.  The bit that changes the position are the numbers in parentheses ``at (14.2,2.7)''

    I am writing to express my strong interest in the \textbf{Senior Scientist -- Computational Chemistry} position at Neomorph. With a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering and a postdoctoral fellowship, I have 7 years of experience in high-throughput molecular modeling and free energy analysis--along with 4 years of experimental work in drug delivery and liposomal formulation--I bring a multidisciplinary approach and passion for solving complex scientific challenges through computation.
		
    While my background does not stem from a traditional drug discovery pipeline, my expertise is \textbf{highly transferable} to your work in targeted protein degradation and molecular glue discovery. I have developed and deployed simulation frameworks to study phase behavior, molecular relaxation, and structural transitions in polymer systems--work that mirrors the goals of small molecule design and binding optimization. My projects have involved modeling complex, high-parameter molecular systems using \textbf{GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulations (C++/CUDA)}, extensive scripting with \textbf{Python and Bash}, and analysis of \textbf{free energy landscapes}, positioning me well for applications such as ligand scoring, ADMET prediction, and molecular design.
		
    What I believe sets me apart is the combination of \textbf{deep computational expertise} and \textbf{hands-on experimental insight}. During my M.S.~research, I developed ultrasound-sensitive liposomal drug carriers and nanoparticle formulations to improve breast cancer treatment outcomes--giving me first-hand understanding of the biophysical, chemical, and clinical variables that impact therapeutic design. This foundation has since been complemented by my work in molecular simulations, where I have led NSF-funded HPC projects, mentored research teams, and presented at over 27 conferences internationally.

		I am inspired by Neomorph's mission to transform treatment paradigms, and I am eager to contribute computational tools and thinking that can accelerate discovery and deepen mechanistic insight. Thank you for considering my application. I would be delighted to speak further about how I can support your drug discovery efforts at Neomorph.
